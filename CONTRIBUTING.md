# Contributing to RDMnet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the RDMnet project!

## Pull requests

The RDMnet library and applications are currently in very early development;
the codebase is quite young, and it implements a standard that has not yet been
published. In order to keep things as stable as possible, we are not accepting
pull requests at this time.
